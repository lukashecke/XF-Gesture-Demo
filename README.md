# Xamarin.Forms Gesture Demo - Open Source

Handeling touch input can be quite a phenomenon with Xamarin.Forms. Although Microsoft offers a good [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/graphics/skiasharp/transforms/touch) on how to implement this, the output we get from `void OnTouchEffectAction(object sender, TouchActionEventArgs args)` it not so straight foreward. Especially the multitouch is tough to realize, because we always get one single touch back.  
This little demo application let us watch e.g. how multiple fingers on the screens are processed in the background.
